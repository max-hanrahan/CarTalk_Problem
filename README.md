# CarTalk_Problem
Script I used to render slides for a talk I gave on YouTube: [The "Car Talk" Problem with No Elegant Solution](https://youtu.be/M0e6v_9aamY). 

"Script" has a double meaning here: I use [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) and the [advanced-slides plugin](https://github.com/MSzturc/obsidian-advanced-slides) to render the slides, but they also contain the notes I read from when viewing the slides. 

I lost the Manim code that I used to render the equations, but it wasn't terribly hard to make from scratch. I followed some of the [examples given here](https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/jupyter/user/manimcommunity-jupyter_examples-zkqh2dsq/notebooks/First%20Steps%20with%20Manim.ipynb).
